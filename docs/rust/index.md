This site is a work in progress. The contents are neither finished nor polished. 

As per our current timeline, we should be ready by the 10th anniversary of Vulkan i.e. 16th february, 2026.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn to write programs that utilise Vulkan APIs. The implementation language of choice will be Rust. I learnt Vulkan directly from scratch, and I shifted to other APIs only after I had a decent grasp over vulkan. This strengthened my belief that one can learn vulkan directly, and so this tutorial is aimed at making you learn vulkan directly without prior graphics knowledge. If you are looking for something that build on top of your prior knowledge/skills, then you should look elsewhere.

Many authers/bloggers suggest learning OpenGL first before learning vulkan. I don't subscribe to that school of thought. Just because one cannot teach, doesn't mean you shouldn't learn. As a author, its my job to collect all the resources that you need in one place, so that you don't have to hop around here and there and accumulate confusion.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Rust
  - Alternatively, an expert of C++, so that you can re-implement the example programs yourself in C++
- A machine with graphics card capable of handling Vulkan APIs

## Tutorial Guidelines
- If something can be said in fewer words, say it in fewer words
- Assume zero prior knowledge
