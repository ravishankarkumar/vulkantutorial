# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn to write programs that utilise Vulkan APIs. The implementation language of choice will be Rust. I learnt Vulkan directly from scratch, and have zero idea about other graphics APIs such as OpenGL, DirectX or Metal. This implies that this tutorial assumes no previous graphics knowledge. If you are looking for something that build on top of your prior knowledge/skills, then you should look elsewhere.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Rust
  - Alternatively, an expert of C++, so that you can re-implement the example programs yourself in C++
- A machine with graphics card capable of handling Vulkan APIs

## Tutorial Guidelines
- If something can be said in fewer words, say it in fewer words
- If a concept needs to be repeated, repeat it
- Assume zero knowledge, even for the programming language that we are using
