# Introduction
The trick to befriend someone is to spend as much time as possible with them, without being needy.

Before, we start to draw a triangle, we will spend some time with Vulkan, learning basic concepts. Let's get started.

::: info Rust required
If you want to write code along with me. Then ensure you know little bit of Rust. Maybe, [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) can help.

EXCEPTION: If you to follow along in c++ or any other language, then you are on your own.
